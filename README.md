# CANsniffer_vxl
# [WIP]

Writing a CLI application that allows user to sniff broadcast CAN traffic using supported Vector hardware and driver library. In future I'd like to allow it to be able to send user-defined Tx messages to the bus also.

## Topics:
- Device Drivers
- C / C++
- CAN bus communication
- Hardware interaction
- Embedded systems programming
- CLI Development
